# DualPort_RAM
Overview

This project implements a Dual Port RAM (Random Access Memory) in Verilog, suitable for use in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) designs. Dual Port RAM allows simultaneous read and write operations on separate ports, providing flexibility in accessing and modifying data.
Features

    Dual Port architecture for concurrent read and write operations.
    Configurable data width and depth to suit specific project requirements.
    Synchronous design for reliable and predictable behavior.
    Easily integrable into FPGA projects.
